Hello!

You can play with the runner now.

. exit_job
    Exit current action job with success.

. load_job
    Load environment variables that are available inside job steps, for
    example variables starting with the "GITHUB_" prefix.

/tmp/log
    A FIFO that redirects everything from it to the log on GitHub Action.
    For example, the following command will print bash history to log:

        history > /tmp/log

    WINDOWS ONLY: When using a bash-incompatible tools from bash shell,
    the FIFO may not work, but "\\.\pipe\log" may work instead.

$GH_ARTIFACT
    An environment variable set by ". load_job" script containing a path.
    Content of this directory will be published as a workflow artifact.
    For example, you can compress and send current directory to the artifact:

        tar -czf $GH_ARTIFACT/workspace.tgz .

    Artifact will be available only after successful finish of workflow run,
    so you have to call ". exit_job" when you're done.

ghctx
    Command outputs GitHub Actions context value. For example, show runner OS:

        ghctx runner.os

    WINDOWS ONLY: The context contains OS-compatible paths, but if you are
    using bash in Windows, you may want to convert them to bash-compatible
    paths with the "-p" option.
