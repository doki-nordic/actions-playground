Hello!

You can play with the runner now.

Currently, PowerShell is not fully supported. Some of commands below may
work only in cmd.

exit_job
    Exit current action job with success.

load_job
    Load environment variables that are available inside job steps, for
    example variables starting with the "GITHUB_" prefix.

\\.\pipe\log
    A named pipe that redirects everything from it to the log on GitHub Action.
    For example, the following command will print your history to log:

        doskey /history > \\.\pipe\log

%GH_ARTIFACT%
    An environment variable set by "load_job" script containing a path.
    Content of this directory will be published as a workflow artifact.
    For example, you can compress and send current directory to the artifact:

        tar -czf %GH_ARTIFACT%\workspace.tgz .

    Artifact will be available only after successful finish of workflow run,
    so you have to call "exit_job" when you're done.

ghctx
    Command outputs GitHub Actions context value. For example, show runner OS:

        ghctx runner.os
