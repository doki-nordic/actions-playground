Hello Developer!

Now, you can play with the runner.

Things that you may want to know:

 * "exit_job" command will terminate GitHub Actions job that you are
   currently using. As the result, entire workflow will end with a success.
 * ". /tmp/job_vars" command will source all environment variables that
   are available inside a job. It will also change current directory to the
   job's workspace directory.
 * "GHCTX_***" environment variable sourced from "/tmp/job_vars" are taken
   from the GitHub Actions Contexts, e.g. "GHCTX_SECRETS_GITHUB_TOKEN"
   contains value from ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }} context value. Not all
   values are available. See .github/workflows/action.yml for list of values.
   Edit it if you need more.
