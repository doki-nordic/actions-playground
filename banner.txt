Hello Developer!

Now, you can play with the runner.

Things that you may want to know:

 * "exit_job" command will terminate GitHub Actions job that you are
   currently using. As the result, entire workflow will end with a success.
 * ". job_vars" command will source all environment variables that
   are available inside a job. It will also change current directory to the
   job's workspace directory.
 * "$LOG" FIFO allows you to send messages to the Action log, e.g.
   "history > $LOG" will put your bash history on the log. This may
   be useful for creating a workflow with commands that you used.
 * "$ARTIFACT" directory will be available as an action artifact.
   Put there anything you want to download later.
 * "GHCTX_***" environment variable sourced from "/tmp/job_vars" are taken
   from the GitHub Actions Contexts, e.g. "GHCTX_SECRETS_GITHUB_TOKEN"
   contains value from ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }} context value. Not all
   values are available. See .github/workflows/action.yml for list of values.
   Edit it if you need more.

You have some examples of commands in your bash history (arrow up key).

On Window with different shell:

 * exit_job the same
 * job_vars instead of ". job_vars"
 * %LOG% instead of $LOG <------- NOOOOO! FIFO is different from named pipe, but maybe named pipe will work for both cases?
 * %ARTIFACT% instead of $ARTIFACT <-------- Check if path translation will work here, if not, old approach will be needed: bash: /tmp/artifact, other: %ARTIFACT%
